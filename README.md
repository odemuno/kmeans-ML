# kmeans-ML
 A mathematical presentation on the K-means Clustering Algorithm


This presentation explores how we can:
- define classification and clustering
- explore the applications of clustering in machine learning
- understand the steps to clustering
- define $K$-means clustering
- implement the $K$-means algorithm to cluster data (scikit-learn)
- find the optimal $K$ value

It also includes the following examples:
- K-means on the famous Iris dataset
- K-means for image color compression
- K-means for market customer segmentation
