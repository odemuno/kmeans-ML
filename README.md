# K-means Clustering Algorithm
 A mathematical presentation on the K-means Clustering Algorithm. This was a final research project for the UCSD MATH 157 Intro to Mathematical Software class (WI'21) taught by Thomas Grubb https://www.math.ucsd.edu/~tgrubb/math157/.


This presentation explores how we can:
- define classification and clustering
- explore the applications of clustering in machine learning
- understand the steps to clustering
- define K-means clustering
- implement the K-means algorithm to cluster data (Scikit-learn)
- find the optimal K value

It also includes the following examples:
- K-means on the famous Iris dataset
- K-means for image color compression
- K-means for market customer segmentation

Packages used: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook
